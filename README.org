#+TITLE: MAX Test

Firmware to use a large (but programmable amount of FPGA resources).
Based on firmware written by Alex Madorsky


Adjust to your liking the parameters:

#+begin_src verilog
parameter R     = 11000; // number of shift registers
parameter SN    = 144; // length of each shift register
parameter BRAMS = 1500;
#+end_src

Make sure to update the XDC file with ports and clock frequency.
- clk should be a clock
- outp should be an unconnected pin, or at least a pin that can be driven with arbitrary signals without causing damage.
